## Overview Video
A video was recorded during a PnP Monthly Community call and that video is available here: [Community Demo - Microsoft 365 Learning Pathways Architectural Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-QFDNRZkGE&feature=youtu.be). It may help you gain a better understanding of what Microsoft 365 learning pathways is and how to go about using it.

## Prerequisites

- You will need to be a tenant administrator to be able to deploy this solution to the target tenant.
Note that you can get free developer tenant from [Office 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev-program), if needed
- Automatic end-to-end provisioning only works with English tenants. All solutions and web parts are also English in the current implementation
- A tenant `App Catalog` must have been created within the `Apps` option of the SharePoint Admin Center. Please see [Set up your Office 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant#create-app-catalog-site) and follow the Create app catalog site section. If your tenant-wide App Catalog has already been provisioned, you will need access to an account that has rights to upload a package to it to complete this setup process. Generally, this is an account with the SharePoint administrator role. If an account with that role does not work, go to the SharePoint admin center and find the Site Collection Administrators for the app catalog site collection and either log in as one of the Site Collection Administrators, or add the SharePoint administrator account that failed to the Site Collection Administrators. You will also need access to an account that is a SharePoint Tenant Admin.

## Updating the solution

### Current Release Version

![drop](https://img.shields.io/badge/drop-3.0.1-green.svg)

For a list of issues/updates made in each release see the [Change Log](./webpart/ChangeLog.md).

>**CRITICAL: Version 3.x.x Upgrade Notice**
>
>The version 3.x.x version is a major update and includes changes to the schema from version 2.x.x. Although it has been tested throughly, as with any major update you should plan for the worst and back up your content before proceeding. There are many third party solutions that will assist you with this, if you do not have access to any then the simplest method is to back up your content using Microsoft Excel. Specifically all the items in the _CustomPlaylists_ and _CustomAssets_ lists plus the `CustomSubCategories` item in the _CustomConfig_ list. Please see [Backup Playlist Content](./webpart/BackupInstructions.md) for more detail instructions.

The current solution is provided in it's packaged form in the web part folder [customlearning.sppkg](./webpart/customlearning.sppkg).

To validate the version of the web part installed in your tenant you must have access to the tenant-wide App Catalog. The custom learning solution will be installed there and you can verify the current version number against the **_version number noted above_** (not the version in the screen shot).

If you find that your package is out of date, you can download it from this repository and then upload it into your tenant app catalog (you will need appropriate access to do this step).

To download the SPPKG file, navigate to the [customlearning.sppkg](https://github.com/pnp/custom-learning-office-365/blob/master/webpart/customlearning.sppkg) file in the webpart folder of this repository. Select `Download` to save the file to your computer.

Navigate to the site collection that is your custom learning master site, then site contents, and then click on the menu for `Microsoft 365 learning pathways` and select Details. (Previously called Custom Learning for Office 365)
