## Overview Video

A video was recorded during a PnP Monthly Community call and that video is available here: [Community Demo - Microsoft 365 Learning Pathways Architectural Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sLXl_rKGxQ). It may help you gain a better understanding of what Microsoft 365 learning pathways is and how to go about using it.

In addition there is a new recording showing an overview of the V4 multilingual release available here: [Microsoft 365 learning pathways v4 Feature Overview](https://youtu.be/xayqnUAcGXc)

## Prerequisites

- You will need to be a tenant administrator to be able to deploy this solution to the target tenant.
Note that you can get free developer tenant from [Office 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev-program), if needed
- Automatic end-to-end provisioning only works with English tenants. With the version 4.x.x release, web parts are available in multiple languages, for more information see [Overview of multilingual support for learning pathways](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/customlearning/custom_overview_ml).
- A tenant `App Catalog` must have been created within the `Apps` option of the SharePoint Admin Center. Please see [Set up your Office 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant#create-app-catalog-site) and follow the Create app catalog site section. If your tenant-wide App Catalog has already been provisioned, you will need access to an account that has rights to upload a package to it to complete this setup process. Generally, this is an account with the SharePoint administrator role. If an account with that role does not work, go to the SharePoint admin center and find the Site Collection Administrators for the app catalog site collection and either log in as one of the Site Collection Administrators, or add the SharePoint administrator account that failed to the Site Collection Administrators. You will also need access to an account that is a SharePoint Tenant Admin.

## Updating the solution

### Current Release Version

![drop](https://img.shields.io/badge/drop-4.4-green.svg)

For a list of issues/updates made in each release see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

>**CRITICAL: Version 4.x.x Upgrade Notice**
>
>The version 4.x.x version is a major update and includes changes to the schema as well as support for multilingual pages.

>**_PLEASE_** review the content of [Adding Multilingual Support to Microsoft 365 learning pathways](./installation/AddingMultilingualSupport.md) document before proceeding.

>Although it has been tested thoroughly, as with any major update you should plan for the worst and back up your content first. There are many third party solutions that will assist you with this, if you do not have access to any then the simplest method is to back up your content using Microsoft Excel. Specifically all the items in the _CustomPlaylists_ and _CustomAssets_ lists plus the `CustomSubCategories` item in the _CustomConfig_ list. Please see [Backup Playlist Content](./installation/BackupInstructions.md) for more detail instructions.
>
>*Additional Update for CDN Url*
>
>The base CDN url of the web part has changed in version 3.x.x. For the majority of users the web part will handle this change internally, however, in some instances customers who have installed learning pathways manually between July 27, 2019 and November 4, 2019 may have an invalid CDN endpoint. If after updating to version 3.x.x the content won't load, please run the [UpdateM365lpCDN.ps1](./installation/UpdateM365lpCDN.ps1) PowerShell script to correct the CDN endpoint. Even if you do not have a problem, you may optionally run this script to update to the most optimized CDN url.

The current solution is provided in it's packaged form in the web part folder [customlearning.sppkg](./installation/customlearning.sppkg).

To validate the version of the web part installed in your tenant you must have access to the tenant-wide App Catalog. The custom learning solution will be installed there and you can verify the current version number against the **_version number noted above_** (not the version in the screen shot).

![Tenant App Catalog Screenshot](./images/TenantAppCatalog.png)

If you find that your package is out of date, you can download it from this repository and then upload it into your tenant app catalog (you will need appropriate access to do this step).

To download the SPPKG file, navigate to the [customlearning.sppkg](https://github.com/pnp/custom-learning-office-365/blob/main/installation/customlearning.sppkg) file in the webpart folder of this repository. Select `Download` to save the file to your computer.

![Download SPPKG file screenshot](./images/DownloadSPPKG.png)

Upload this file into the app catalog by selecting upload, finding the file, and then selecting Deploy.

![Upload new sppkg file to tenant app catalog](./images/UploadPackage.png)

![Deploy package to tenant](./images/DeployM365LP.png)

If you've updated the package you will also want to update it in the custom learning site collection. Navigate to the site collection that is your custom learning main site, then site contents, and then click on the menu for `Microsoft 365 learning pathways` and select Details. (Previously called Custom Learning for Office 365)

![Site Collection App Version](./images/SiteCollectionAppVersion.png)

If your application needs to be updated in this site collection you will see that there is a new version and you can select the `Get It` link to update.

![Update App](./images/UpdateApp.png)

Finally, in your main custom learning site, navigate to the Site Pages library and to the `CustomLearningAdmin.aspx` page. Make sure this admin page load successfully without error. You may be prompted to complete a 'Data Upgrade' if you are updating to a new major version of the solution. Please run the update and assuming everything works as expected you would then close the update and the admin web part will load the content. If you have problems at this point, please open a new issue for assistance.

## Manually installing and configuring Microsoft 365 learning pathways

We encourage you to install the Microsoft 365 learning pathways solution using the [SharePoint look book](https://lookbook.microsoft.com/), however we recognize that the permissions that service require are significant and not all organizations will feel comfortable utilizing it. To that end this section outlines a manual method of installing the solution. After complete, updates can be applied by following the section above for [Updating the solution](#Updating-the-solution).

### SharePoint Framework Version

![drop](https://img.shields.io/badge/drop-1.12.1-green.svg)

The Microsoft Custom Learning Web Part is build using the [SharePoint Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview). To manually install and configure the web part and site collection you will need to complete the steps outlined in the [Manually installing and configuring Microsoft 365 learning pathways Instructions](./installation/README.md)

## Disabling telemetry collection

Microsoft collects active usage data from your organization’s use of Microsoft 365 learning pathways and the use of Microsoft’s online content. Microsoft will use this data to help improve the future Microsoft 365 learning pathways solutions. To learn more about Microsoft privacy policies see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839).

If you would like to opt out of this data collection, please follow these instructions:

1. Go to script `M365lpConfiguration.ps1`.
1. Change the `$optInTelemetry = $true` command line to `$false`.
1. Run the script with the change implemented.

If you are not performing a manual install and would like to turn telemetry tracking off, a separate script `TelemetryOptOut.ps1` has been included that when run will disable telemetry tracking.

## Changing the URL of your Microsoft 365 learning pathways site

If you need to rename the url of the main Microsoft 365 learning pathways site you can do so but it will also require you to run a PowerShell script to update the Tenant App property that controls what that site URL is for the web parts. After renaming the URL in the SharePoint Admin Center or via PowerShell additionally run teh following script to update the Tenant App property.
[UpdateM365lpSiteUrl.ps1](./installation/UpdateM365lpSiteUrl.ps1)
