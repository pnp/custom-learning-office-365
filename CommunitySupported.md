# Microsoft 365 Learning Pathways: A New Chapter Begins

Big news for organizations leveraging Microsoft 365 Learning Pathways: starting **December 1, 2025**, this powerful microlearning platform will transition to a **fully community-supported solution**. This marks a pivotal shift in how we deliver, maintain, and evolve training content across Microsoft 365 environments.
You can read the official [Microsoft Announcement here](https://aka.ms/M365LPUpdate).

## What’s Changing?

Historically, Microsoft provided the core content and funded development, while the community handled feature development, upgrades, and end user support. Now, the **Microsoft 365 community will take full ownership**—from content updates to solution support. This change empowers us to respond faster to evolving needs and deliver more tailored learning experiences.

A new architecture, spearheaded by [Derek Cash-Peterson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcashpeterson/) and a dedicated team of MVPs, will allow **community members to request new playlists or request edits to existing playlists in addition to making feature requests**. This model mirrors other successful community-led initiatives and ensures quality through peer review and collaboration.

## What does this mean for you and your organization

If you are currently using Microsoft 365 Learning Pathways this should not affect your organization. You can continue to use Microsoft 365 Learning Pathways as you always have. New content updates will continue to flow to your installation of Microsoft 365 Learning Pathways. You can still request support from GitHub. If you see a content gap you will now have the ability to submit that as an enhancement. In addition, you can expect new content at a quicker refresh rate. We aim to release requests promptly.  

## Why This Matters

Learning Pathways has always been about **empowering organizations to deliver contextual, bite-sized training to their users**. Whether you're an end user, IT admin, change management leader, or training manager, this transition opens the door to:

- Faster content updates
- Richer customization
- Community-driven innovation

## What’s the process

Any member of the M365 community can make a request for new content or a request to edit or enhance existing content. The request needs to include links to the resources that should be included in the new content. **Currently we can only support links to content that live under support.microsoft.com**. The managers of the repo will review the request and ensure that it is accurate and contains the needed information. The managers of the repository may make changes to the request to better align with other content or other requests. In the event of conflicting requests or questionable relevancy the repository manager has the final say. Once the content has been created, translated, and tested, it will be released to the public, and your issue will request will be updated. Keep in mind we will do our best to be timely, but this is a volunteer effort.
